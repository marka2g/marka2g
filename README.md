üëã Hi There üëã

My name is Mark Sadegi and I'm thankful everyday to be able to earn a living from programming! Listed first is [Mark's Markdown](https://marksmarkdown.com/elevator-pitch.html){:target="_blank"} which is an application I built to house a collection of writings and personal software engineering notes; think of it as `self.api_docs` üòÅ. Below that is a link to my online resume. Last, links to a few of my public repos that showcase my work.
